#### Deadline: **23.12.2021, 10:00**

#### Notes:

_If you have any remarks about your submission (e.g., you couldn't complete all tasks, you had troubles with a particular task...), please let your tutor know by adding a comment here or in the Jupyter notebook._


#### Setup:
Make sure that the Jupyter-notebook file (`g*.ipynb`) and the Java file (`G*.java`) are in the same directory as the `ipr.py` or `IPR.java` file. You cannot copy the source files somewhere else, without these additional files.

If you get Python import errors, make sure that [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), numpy and OpenCV are installed correctly. 
For example try to run `pip install matplotlib opencv-python numpy` on the command line.
